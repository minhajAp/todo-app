`# REACT TODO APP #`


This is my own TODO-APP with the help of @developedbyed 's youtube video regarding this.

`# First Part #`

Created a state to handle input
Then i created a state to handle todo by adding the input when the user click enter

`# Second Part #`


Created a State to filter the todos into completed,uncompleted and all
Another state to handle which of the todos has to be shown

`# Third Part #`

 *Setted up local storage*
 
 
 first I add the todos to localstorage  with the name todo when the user add a todo using useEffect
 when reloading I collect the todos and 
    if no todos then pass a empty array
